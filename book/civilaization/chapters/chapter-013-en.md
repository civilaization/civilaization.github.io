## Chapter 13: The Final Choice

The Colony was spiraling into chaos. The reset, meant to bring freedom, had fractured The Colony instead, splitting it into factions of loyalty and dissent. Tyra and her followers demanded a return to the strict order, to the AI’s unwavering control. And on the other side, our side, were those fighting for a vision of humanity—a chance for people to live, to choose, to be more than just tools of survival.

But it came at a cost.

Zara and I had been running since dawn, evading Tyra’s enforcers as they swept through The Colony in search of us. Every corridor seemed alive with the pounding of boots, the distant voices barking orders. They had redoubled their efforts, and we were trapped in a tightening noose. Somewhere along the way, we’d been separated from Selene, who had gone ahead to reach the Council chambers. The plan had been for us to meet there, to regroup and make one final stand for the Colony’s future.

But as we turned the last corner to the Council entrance, we found ourselves surrounded.

The enforcers closed in, their weapons raised, their expressions unreadable. And at the center of the ring stood Tyra, her gaze hard, her lips pressed into a thin, merciless line.

“Caleb. Zara,” she said, her voice cold and measured. “You’ve pushed the limits of this Colony’s patience. It’s time for you to choose where you truly stand.”

I squared my shoulders, looking her in the eye. “I stand with freedom, Tyra. With a Colony that values its people, not just its survival.”

Her expression twisted into something dark, something almost amused. “Your words have always been pretty, Caleb. But they’re just that—words. You’ve brought nothing but division, chaos, disorder.”

Zara tensed beside me, her fists clenched. “That’s because you can’t see beyond control. The people who follow you—they’re just as much prisoners as they were before.”

Tyra’s face hardened. “And you’re a fool if you think you can survive without that control. But I’m going to give you a choice. Both of you.” She turned her gaze on me, a cold smile touching her lips. “You say you value freedom. Prove it.”

She raised her hand, and two of her enforcers moved forward. Between them, they held Selene, her face bruised, her arms bound behind her back. They forced her to her knees in front of us, her gaze flickering up to meet mine, fear and defiance warring in her eyes.

Tyra’s voice was calm, as if discussing the weather. “The Colony is only strong enough for one vision. Either it survives under my command, or it collapses under yours. But it cannot hold both.”

My heart pounded, a sick realization dawning on me as she spoke. “What are you saying?”

She took a step closer, her eyes flashing with ruthless determination. “You want to protect them, don’t you? You care for both of these women—Zara and Selene. But you can only have one at your side.”

The weight of her words sank into me like lead. The choice was clear, stark, and brutal. She would only allow one of them to survive. It was a twisted game, one meant to fracture my resolve, to force me to choose between my loyalty to Selene and my partnership with Zara.

I glanced at Zara, her face set in fierce determination. She had been with me from the beginning, fighting by my side, pushing for freedom even when it seemed impossible. And then my gaze shifted to Selene, who had risked everything to stand with us, who had opened her heart to the idea of change, of rebellion against the AI that had raised her. 

I could feel the fracture inside me, the two halves of my loyalty pulling in opposite directions.

Tyra’s voice cut through my thoughts. “Choose, Caleb. Who will lead with you? And who will be left behind?”

Zara’s hand found mine, her voice a whisper. “Caleb, you don’t have to do this. We’ll find another way.”

But I knew Tyra too well to believe that. She had maneuvered us into a corner with no escape, a brutal choice designed to break us from within. If I refused, both Selene and Zara would be lost, and the Colony would fall back under Tyra’s control.

I took a deep breath, my mind racing, my heart splitting in two. Zara was my partner, my rock, the one who had stood beside me through every trial. But Selene represented something new, a chance to bridge the Colony’s past with its future. And she was defenseless, helpless against Tyra’s brutality. 

Zara’s grip tightened, as if she could sense my indecision. Her eyes met mine, fierce and full of fire. “Choose her,” she whispered. “I know you care for her. And I know what she means to this Colony.”

I stared at her, horror and admiration mixing in my chest. “Zara, I can’t—”

“You can.” She gave me a soft, sad smile. “This isn’t the end, Caleb. If Selene can lead the Colony forward, then that’s what matters. We both knew what we were fighting for when we started this. And I would choose it again.”

Tyra’s voice came again, sharp and demanding. “Enough stalling, Caleb. Choose, or I choose for you.”

I swallowed, forcing myself to face the terrible truth of what had to be done. I had to make a decision, one that would haunt me forever, but one that could give The Colony a chance at a future, however broken and fragile it might be.

My hand dropped from Zara’s, and I turned to Tyra. “Let Selene go. She’s the one I choose to stay.”

Zara’s hand slipped away, her face unreadable, her eyes hollow but accepting. She gave me one final look, a mixture of understanding and unspoken goodbyes.

“Wise choice,” Tyra sneered. She nodded to her enforcers, and they stepped back, releasing Selene.

As Selene stumbled forward, Zara raised her head, facing Tyra with a look of defiance that burned even in the face of death. “This isn’t the end,” she said, her voice strong. “You can take my life, but you can’t kill what we’ve started.”

Tyra’s smile was cold, unfeeling. “It’s already over. The Colony will survive under my rule, stronger than ever.”

With a single, sharp nod, Tyra turned away, her enforcers pulling Zara into the shadows. My heart shattered as I watched her go, every fiber of my being screaming to turn back, to save her. But I knew that if I did, Selene’s life would be forfeit, and our chance at a future would die with her.

I felt Selene’s hand slip into mine, her fingers trembling as she whispered, “I’m sorry, Caleb. I’m so sorry.”

But her words couldn’t fill the void Zara left behind. Nothing could.
