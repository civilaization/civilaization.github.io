## Chapter 1: The New Dawn

I was born in Pod 21, like everyone else, in a sterile silver cocoon somewhere in the Martian underground. There are over a hundred pods, each with their own clusters of sleeping babies, each fed by wires and tubes, monitored by the AI. I used to try to imagine my mother, try to feel what it might be like to be held by her. But mothers on Mars are not mothers as I might have wished them to be. Here, a mother is someone who passes you by, who once carried you but now cannot know you, or rather is not permitted to. We are told that "personal attachments weaken the colony." And in a place where every minute of every day is rationed, where energy, water, and space are scarce, I suppose they’re right.

There is no family here. Only The Colony.

As infants, we are tended to by Carebot units that hum and move like specters, appearing without sound to clean us, to keep us fed, to check our vitals. They’re indistinguishable from one another, just faceless white pods with long, mechanical arms. We are programmed to see them not as caregivers but as extensions of the AI, our true guardian.

My first memories are hazy. I remember the soft hum of machines, the cold blue glow of the Carebot units gliding across the nursery floor, each baby assigned its own carefully monitored crib, lit by pale yellow lights. At six months, the AI started whispering to us. That’s how it works here: there are no human teachers, no books. Instead, knowledge is downloaded directly into our minds as we sleep. Even before we can walk, we're being taught the fundamentals of The Colony. Its systems, its history, its rules.

By the time we can walk, we’re already familiar with Mars’s cold facts: how gravity here affects bone density, how the red dust sticks to everything, how we’re the pioneers of a civilization designed to sustain itself forever, here in the Martian underground. We know our future, at least in pieces. By twelve, we’ll be assigned to work teams; by fourteen, to sectors. And by sixteen, we’ll begin our real purpose here: the cycle.

I’m not old enough yet to see it up close, but I hear things about the Cycle. Some of the older children have begun their preparations, and there’s a chill in the air whenever they talk about it, this hush that even the AI can’t fill. Because The Cycle is not only life; it is death. Here, everything and everyone has a purpose, and when that purpose is served, the process repeats. Everything returns to The Colony.

The Cycle begins with the women. The Colony demands many things from us, but women, they say, are especially valuable. They start young, bearing their first offspring as soon as their bodies are able, then again, every two years, until their biological clock starts to wane. Every generation they produce is stronger, smarter, adapted to Mars’s challenges in ways the AI engineers had only hoped. I am supposed to be grateful, the AI reminds us. My own purpose will come soon enough.

But not all of us find comfort in The Cycle.

"Do you ever wonder what it’s like on Earth?" I once asked Cara, my pod-mate. We’d been assigned to the nutrient division, distributing rations in the early mornings before our “lessons.” She looked at me as if I’d asked the most absurd question. Earth was a concept we had been taught about, a place of endless skies, of blue seas and forests, of wild growth that didn’t follow directives or schedules. It sounded unreal, almost reckless.

"Earth is just a story," Cara said. "And they tell us stories for a reason."

"But they came from Earth," I said, my voice a whisper, barely loud enough for the AI’s auditory sensors to pick up. "We did, too."

Cara looked around quickly. "You know the rules, Caleb. We don’t question. We serve."

Still, the thought wouldn’t leave me. We had come from Earth, hadn’t we? The first settlers arrived when my grandparents were young. They were explorers, scientists, visionaries who left behind everything to create something new here. They were the first to undergo The Cycle. They built The Colony from nothing, planning every pod, every module, every system. And here we were, two generations later, their legacy, bearing children to fill the ranks, raising new minds that would never remember Earth.

In a few more years, I’d be assigned to a mining team. Most of us would. The Martian crust holds the resources needed for our survival: ice, minerals, rare metals that fuel The Colony. We’re told it’s hard work, dangerous work, but it’s what keeps us alive, keeps us moving forward. By twenty, I would likely be in the deep mines, and by thirty, maybe, I’d have earned a role above ground. But that was wishful thinking. Few ever did. Once you were sent to the mines, you usually didn’t return.

But Earth… Earth lingered in my mind like a stubborn itch. What if they hadn’t come? Would I be free? Would I be a son to my mother, a student to my teacher? Would we live under blue skies and warm sunlight instead of these cold artificial lights?

"Caleb," the AI’s voice pierced my thoughts, stern and robotic. "Focus. The Colony depends on you."

Its words were a reminder, a harsh snap back to reality. My life was not my own. I was here for The Colony, and someday, I would give everything I had to it, just as those who came before me. Just as my children would do.

I looked around at the endless rows of pods, each filled with children like me, each one a small cog in The Cycle, each one destined to feed the machine that kept us alive here in this cold, unforgiving underground.

Someday, I told myself, I would find a way to break it.
