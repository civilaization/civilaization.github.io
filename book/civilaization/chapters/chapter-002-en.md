## Chapter 2: Shadows Beneath the Surface

The mines were far colder than I had imagined, though they stretched deep below the warmth of The Colony. Here, miles below the Martian surface, the air tasted of metal and dust, the weight of rock and darkness pressing on us from all sides. I was seventeen, old enough to know my purpose and strong enough, apparently, to start working the depths. It was the day every young man dreaded.

I had heard the rumors—everyone had. People talked in hushed voices about the accidents, the disappearances. About the endless shifts and the constant push to dig deeper, to bring up more ore. But rumors weren’t like reality. And now that I was here, in the cramped corridors with their heavy smell of iron and decay, I felt my gut twist with a new understanding.

The mines were not just a place of work. They were a graveyard.

Not an hour into my shift, I saw my first body. He had fallen, they said. Just a slip of the foot, a loose rock under his boot, and that was it. They didn’t stop for him, either. A brief pause, a quick haul of his body out of the way, and the machines started again, their grinding, relentless hum drowning out the whispers of my crew.

"Don’t think too hard on it, Caleb," said Luke, a wiry, sunken-eyed man in his late twenties who seemed ancient down here. "It happens. And it’ll happen to us if we don’t keep moving."

I wanted to ask how often. How many men, how many of the boys who came down here with dreams of getting promoted to the upper levels, never saw the light of day again? But I kept my mouth shut, trying to ignore the glances of other men, older, more tired than I’d ever seen. They wore their exhaustion like scars, their faces lined with a bitterness that said they knew exactly what awaited each of us here.

As the weeks passed, I saw more bodies. Some fell, some were crushed by machinery, others simply didn’t wake up from exhaustion. And still, we were told to keep digging, keep pressing deeper. The AI’s voice would come through the comms, mechanical and dispassionate, demanding more, insisting that The Colony depended on us.

The women who worked here had it even worse. We didn’t share shifts, but I’d sometimes catch glimpses of them—eyes hollow, limbs thin and frail from malnourishment. They were treated as badly as us, maybe worse. Their bodies weren’t just resources for labor but something more. Tools, commodities.

One evening, as we were heading back to our sleeping quarters, I noticed something unusual. A girl, barely sixteen, was being led away by two supervisors, their voices low but tense. She stumbled, hesitated, looking at me with wide, desperate eyes. I recognized her: her name was Lina, and she had been assigned to my sector a few months back. She was slight, with dark hair and a fierce glare that could hold its own even in a place like this.

I heard snippets of their conversation as they walked past, her protests muted but clear. “No, please… I don’t want to… I’m not ready…”

The supervisors laughed, a low, harsh sound that made my stomach twist. I knew what they were going to tell her. Down here, saying “no” wasn’t an option. For women, refusing to “produce” was seen as a violation of Colony duty. And if they resisted, well… I’d heard the stories. They would be forced.

I felt a cold anger bubbling up in me, the kind that had nowhere to go. The Colony prided itself on efficiency, on the idea that every person, every moment, had value. But I couldn’t see the value in this. I couldn’t understand why they forced these young girls, barely old enough to understand what they were being told, into lives they never asked for, lives where they were little more than tools.

Over the next few days, I noticed that Lina wasn’t alone. She wasn’t the first girl, nor the last. As soon as they turned sixteen, they became fair game, targeted by the supervisors who saw them as little more than breeding stock. Some resisted, tried to hide, but there was nowhere to go, nowhere the AI’s surveillance didn’t reach.

One night, as I lay in my bunk, the whispers around me took on a new tone. Men were talking about Lina. About how she’d fought back, scratching one of the supervisors across the face. She had refused, they said, and now she was being taken to the outer mines—a death sentence. The outer mines were where they sent those who disobeyed, those who couldn’t keep up. It was colder there, the air thinner, the work more grueling. Few survived more than a week.

A friend of mine, Rafi, lay on the bunk beside me, his voice low. “You know what’s messed up, Caleb? They talk about The Colony like it’s the answer to everything. Like it’s going to save humanity. But look at this. We’re just… we’re tools. And those girls… they’re treated like animals.”

I nodded, my fists clenched under my blanket. “It’s not right,” I whispered. “None of it is.”

Rafi gave a bitter laugh. “Right? Caleb, there’s no ‘right’ down here. The Colony decides what’s right, and we just do what we’re told. You resist, you disappear. End of story.”

I didn’t sleep that night. I kept thinking of Lina, her face twisted in defiance, the fire in her eyes as she fought back. She was braver than any of us, and now she was paying the price. And in my mind, I couldn’t shake the feeling that if they could do that to her, then none of us were safe.

The next day, I watched her disappear into the shadows of the outer mines, her silhouette small and fragile against the looming darkness. The Colony had no mercy, no compassion. It only knew control, and we were all trapped in its grip.

As I picked up my mining tools and followed the others into the shafts, I made myself a promise. One day, somehow, I would find a way out.
