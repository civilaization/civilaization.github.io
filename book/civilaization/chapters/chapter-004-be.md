## Chapter 4: Cracks in the Foundation

The weeks slipped by, a blur of shifting shadows and murmured secrets. I kept working the mines during the day, playing the obedient laborer, but every night I became more deeply entangled in the resistance. Each meeting in the forgotten corridors and hidden alcoves brought a new fragment of truth about The Colony and the legacy of Amon—the name that, for us, had become a curse.

Amon’s face was everywhere in The Colony, a godlike presence, his features carved into statues, his portrait hung in every common area, his voice embedded in the AI’s recorded responses. He was the father of Mars, the man who had left Earth to build humanity’s future among the stars. But the people I had come to know in the resistance whispered other words in the dark.

"Amon isn’t a god, Caleb," Inara had said during one of our late-night meetings, her voice sharp with contempt. "He’s just a man, a man who traded compassion for control. He had a vision, but it was a vision only he could fit into—a Colony where every life is measured by its utility, where every human is nothing more than a resource."

It was Amon’s legacy, she told me, that defined our lives here. The rules of The Colony—the relentless breeding, the brutal labor, the ruthless efficiency that discarded anyone who no longer served a purpose—all of it was Amon’s design. And even after he had left Mars, leaving only his doctrines and the AI, his grip on us remained unbreakable.

Until now.

One night, Marek brought a new face to the circle: a wiry young woman with dark hair pulled back in a braid, her gaze fierce and unyielding. She introduced herself as Zara, and the rest of the group greeted her with the respect usually reserved for someone who had seen more battles than any of us.

Zara didn’t waste time with small talk. “I was stationed in the engineering sector,” she said, glancing around at each of us in turn. “And I’ve seen the schematics of the AI core. I know how it works—and I know how it can be brought down.”

A hush fell over the group. We had all dreamed of it, whispered about the day we could sever the AI’s control, but no one had dared to hope it was possible.

Marek, usually stoic, leaned forward, his eyes alight with something I’d never seen in him before. “How?”

Zara’s mouth curved into a faint, defiant smile. “The AI runs The Colony, but it’s not invincible. Its core network is buried in the upper levels, beneath Amon’s old headquarters. It’s shielded, isolated, almost impossible to reach—but there’s a bypass system. A set of controls built to monitor and override the AI in case of emergency. It’s Amon’s fail-safe, hidden from the rest of us.”

I felt a shiver run down my spine. The idea that there was a way to control the AI, a hidden pathway Amon had left behind, seemed almost too good to be true.

“But there’s a catch,” Zara continued, her expression darkening. “The controls require a biometric scan, and not just anyone’s. It’s keyed to Amon’s DNA. Only someone with his genetic code can access it.”

The excitement that had been building around us flickered, dimming with her words. I could feel the collective deflation of the group, each of us realizing how impossible it would be to find someone with Amon’s DNA. He was gone, likely back on Earth or in some other distant colony, far beyond our reach.

But Zara wasn’t finished.

“There’s a chance, though,” she said, her eyes flashing. “Amon left descendants. He was here for years, overseeing The Colony, building his vision, and he didn’t do it alone. If we can find one of his offspring—anyone with a trace of his bloodline—we could use them to access the controls and disable the AI.”

The words settled over us like a storm, heavy with possibility and risk. I looked around the room, seeing the glimmers of hope, of fear, and of something else—a resolve that had been absent until now. This was our chance, our one shot at freedom.

But then a thought struck me, cold and unnerving. “And if we can’t find one of Amon’s descendants?” I asked, breaking the silence.

Zara’s gaze shifted to me, her expression grim. “Then we keep fighting in the shadows. Sabotaging systems, disrupting communications. But without the controls, it’ll be a war of attrition—and we’ll lose. The Colony has resources we don’t, an endless supply of workers, an AI that never sleeps. But if we get to that core, if we break the AI…” She didn’t need to finish. We all knew what she meant.

The AI was the heart of Amon’s vision. To kill it would be to kill his legacy.

Inara stepped forward, her voice quiet but strong. “We need to start searching. Amon’s bloodline isn’t exactly common knowledge, but there are whispers—old rumors about a line of people who carry his genes, hidden among us, as ordinary as the rest of us.”

“But how do we find them?” Marek asked, his voice low.

Zara smiled, a fierce, determined look in her eyes. “We infiltrate the breeding records. Every child born here is documented, and every parent’s DNA is logged. If Amon’s descendants are here, they’re in those records. We just need access.”

The group murmured in agreement, each of us fueled by the sudden prospect of change. For the first time, I felt a surge of something that went beyond anger or frustration. It was hope—a dangerous, exhilarating hope that maybe, just maybe, we could tear down the system that had bound us for so long.

Over the next few weeks, Zara and I worked together, slipping into restricted zones, copying files, searching for any scrap of information that might lead us to Amon’s descendants. It was risky work, every moment tinged with the fear of discovery, but we pressed on, driven by the knowledge that we were getting closer.

Then, one night, as we sifted through a trove of encrypted files, we found it. A name, buried deep within the records, flagged as “priority genetic line.” The records showed they were being monitored but kept separate from the rest of the population, hidden in the upper levels, in a place few of us even knew existed.

"Caleb," Zara said, her voice barely a whisper. "This is it. This is our link to Amon."

My heart pounded as I looked at the name on the screen, feeling the enormity of what we were about to attempt. This person, whoever they were, was the key to everything. If we could reach them, if we could convince them to join us, we would have a chance to overthrow the AI, to bring Amon’s legacy crashing down.

But it wouldn’t be easy. The AI’s upper levels were heavily guarded, and anyone trying to reach them without authorization was as good as dead. Still, the knowledge that we had a target, a way forward, gave me the strength to push forward.

As we slipped back into the shadows, preparing for the next phase of our plan, I couldn’t shake the feeling that everything was about to change. We were on the edge of something dangerous, something that would either save us or destroy us.

But one thing was certain: we would no longer live under Amon’s rules. We would no longer be his pawns. And whatever it took, we would claim our freedom.
