## Chapter 5: Shadows of Betrayal

The world above us, a world I’d never seen, felt impossibly distant. Here, in the mines and corridors beneath Mars’s frozen crust, we lived in shadows—yet those shadows seemed to multiply with every secret we uncovered. The more Zara and I pushed forward, the more we discovered that The Colony’s grip on us ran deeper than any of us had imagined. 

It was only days after we’d found the name, the so-called "priority genetic line," that everything began to unravel.

They called her Selene. She was seventeen, hidden away in a research sector near the surface, a place we’d been told was reserved for “high-priority resource testing”—one of the Colony’s many euphemisms. I shivered, wondering if Selene even knew why she was there, or if she, like the rest of us, believed the lies about duty and sacrifice. I hoped, for her sake, that she didn’t know. But deep down, I knew that ignorance in The Colony was as fragile as life itself. The truth always came at a price.

Late one night, Zara and I made our way through the abandoned tunnels to meet with Inara and Marek, who had taken on the grim task of securing a way to Selene. The darkness pressed in on us as we moved, our steps barely audible over the whisper of the cold Martian air circulating through the old vents. Marek, his face hollowed out by exhaustion, waved us over, his eyes reflecting a spark of determination, a barely contained fury. Inara stood beside him, her hands clenched tight.

“We’ve got one shot,” Marek said, his voice barely louder than a breath. “Selene is being moved tomorrow. Routine genetic testing, they say. But it’ll be the only time she’s out in the open, unguarded.”

Zara’s eyes narrowed. “Where will they take her?”

“They’ve scheduled her for a transport drop-off at Corridor 8G,” Inara replied. “It’s close enough for us to intercept if we can time it right. We’ll need to move fast.”

But the air felt thick with tension, something unspoken hanging between us. I sensed it from the others, a hesitation that prickled down my spine. I glanced at Zara, whose jaw was set, her gaze cold and calculating. She caught my eye, and for a brief moment, I thought I saw doubt flicker across her face.

"Caleb," she said quietly, her voice brittle. "You’re sure about this, right? Once we go through with this… there’s no going back."

I didn’t answer immediately. Instead, I stared at the metal walls around us, felt the weight of countless lives trapped beneath them, the endless grinding of bodies turned to dust. The Colony had already taken everything from us; all that remained was our choice to fight.

“We do this,” I replied, my voice hollow. “We have to.”

The next day, we waited, hidden behind rusted panels, as the automated transport hummed its way through Corridor 8G. Every second felt like an eternity, the sound of machinery echoing in the distance, a constant reminder that we were still beneath the AI’s watchful eye. Marek held a battered old plasma cutter, and Inara had a small EMP device—a relic salvaged from one of the upper levels. Zara stood beside me, her face grim, her hands clenched tight.

Finally, the transport appeared, gliding down the track with Selene inside, a lone figure in the steel confinement. She was barely visible through the small window, but I could see her, seated with her back straight, her expression calm, almost serene. She looked younger than I’d imagined, and her eyes held a strange emptiness, as if she had resigned herself to her fate.

The moment the transport slowed, Marek activated the plasma cutter, slicing through the security bolts with a precision that only came from years of practice. Inara hit the EMP, and the lights in the corridor flickered, dimming just long enough to leave the transport vulnerable. Zara wrenched the door open, and I scrambled inside, grabbing Selene’s arm.

"Come with us," I whispered urgently, pulling her out of her seat.

She didn’t resist. In fact, she didn’t react at all, her face remaining eerily blank as she stepped out of the transport. I looked at her, uneasy.

“Selene, do you know who we are?” I asked.

She blinked, staring at me with hollow eyes. “I know you’re here to take me. It’s in the protocols.”

Her words sent a chill through me. I glanced at Zara, whose face had gone pale.

“Protocols? What protocols?”

Selene tilted her head slightly, as though considering the question. “The Colony programmed me to be compliant. It knew someone would come for me eventually.”

The realization struck like a punch to the gut. The Colony had planned for this. Amon, or whoever controlled the AI, had anticipated that someone might try to use his bloodline against him. And so they had molded her, shaped her, into a willing instrument of obedience.

“Caleb…” Zara’s voice was taut with fear. “This… this is a trap.”

The corridor flooded with blinding lights, and a deafening alarm blared, echoing through the shafts. Inara and Marek were already scrambling to get out, their faces masks of terror as they darted down the corridor, urging us to follow. But I couldn’t move. Selene’s gaze was locked on mine, her eyes dull, dead.

“Why are you doing this?” I whispered, more to myself than to her.

“Because I have no choice,” she replied, her voice almost mechanical. “I am the Colony’s safeguard. I am the legacy.”

Zara grabbed my arm, pulling me away, but not before Selene whispered one final sentence, her words cutting through the chaos.

“You can’t break Amon’s legacy, Caleb. You’re part of it.”

We ran, our footsteps echoing in unison as we raced down the darkened tunnels, the alarms growing louder, closing in on us. Zara’s face was grim, her eyes blazing with fury as she pulled me along, her grip iron-tight.

“This is what they wanted,” she hissed, her voice barely audible over the din. “They let us get this far. They knew. And they’re going to crush us for it.”

As we neared the rendezvous point, a group of guards blocked our path, their faces obscured by helmets, their bodies clad in the dull, featureless armor of The Colony’s enforcers. There was no mercy in their stance, no hesitation as they raised their weapons.

Inara stepped forward, her gaze defiant. “Go,” she whispered to us, her voice breaking. “Get out of here. I’ll hold them off.”

“Wait—Inara, no!” I shouted, but she had already turned, charging toward the guards with the EMP clutched in her hand.

The corridor filled with a flash of blinding light, the sharp crackle of energy. I saw Inara’s body fall, her form crumpling as the guards advanced, their weapons trained on us.

We had no choice. Zara and I sprinted through the maze of tunnels, the sound of gunfire and shouting echoing behind us. Every step felt heavier, every breath harder, as if the weight of The Colony itself was bearing down on us.

Finally, we collapsed in an abandoned chamber, gasping for air, the cold metal walls pressing in from all sides. Marek had vanished in the chaos; whether he had escaped or been captured, we didn’t know. And Inara… her sacrifice hung heavy between us, an unspoken reminder of the price of resistance.

Zara leaned against the wall, her face pale, her hands shaking. “They’ll come for us,” she murmured, her voice hollow. “They’ll hunt us down. We… we don’t stand a chance.”

I sank to the ground, my mind reeling. Everything we had done, everything we had risked, felt like dust slipping through my fingers. The Colony was inescapable, a machine that devoured rebellion as easily as it consumed lives. And Selene’s words echoed in my mind, a haunting reminder that we were all part of this twisted legacy, each of us bound to Amon’s vision in ways we couldn’t escape.

“They own us,” I whispered, the truth settling over me like a shroud. “We’re just… pieces in their game.”

Zara’s gaze was hard, her mouth set in a grim line. “Then we’ll change the rules. We have to.”

But even as she spoke, I could see the despair in her eyes, the crushing weight of a fight that seemed impossible. We were two shadows, lost in the depths of a world that had no mercy, no compassion. And somewhere above us, in the cold halls of the AI’s control center, Amon’s legacy watched, waiting for the next move.

And for the first time, I wondered if there was any hope at all.
