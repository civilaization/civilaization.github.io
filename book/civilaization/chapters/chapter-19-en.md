## Chapter 19: The Martian Legacy

Fifteen years had passed since the fall of Tyra and the final shutdown of the AI core. The Colony had grown, changed, and adapted in ways I could never have imagined. New structures reached toward the sky, greenhouses had doubled in number, and the corridors were filled with the sounds of children—laughter, arguments, and all the noise that came with the lives of a generation born on Mars. 

Among those voices were the ones that meant the most to me: our children, Zara and Leo.

Zara, named after the woman who had sacrificed herself for our freedom, was now fourteen. She was fierce, sharp-witted, and endlessly curious, always pressing us with questions that were difficult to answer. Leo, our younger child at twelve, was gentler, often lost in his own thoughts, his eyes always searching the skies through the Colony’s observation windows, as if he could see the stars even through Mars’s dust-filled atmosphere.

But as much as they filled our lives with joy, they were struggling. Living on Mars, where every breath, every plant, every resource was a hard-won victory, weighed on them. They had never known anything different, yet I could see that the constraints of this life left them restless.

One evening, Selene and I were in the greenhouse, checking on the new batch of hydroponic crops. The soft glow of the grow lights reflected in her eyes as she watched me, a flicker of concern hidden behind her usual calm.

“They’re not happy here, Caleb,” she murmured, her voice heavy with worry. “Zara’s been having nightmares. And Leo… he told me yesterday that he dreams about a sky without walls.”

I leaned against the railing, letting out a long breath. “I know. I see it in the way they look out the observation windows, as if they’re trying to escape. It’s different for them. They’ve only ever known life on Mars.”

Selene looked down, her fingers tracing circles on the railing. “When we were their age, we could see trees, oceans. We could breathe air that didn’t have to be filtered. It’s no wonder they feel caged here.”

The greenhouse was silent except for the faint hum of machinery, the only sounds in this world that had become their home and their prison.

Zara’s restlessness came to a head one morning when she confronted me at the breakfast table, her eyes blazing with frustration. Leo sat beside her, quieter but equally tense, his hands clenching the edge of his chair.

“Why didn’t you tell us?” she demanded, her voice louder than I’d ever heard it. “Why didn’t you tell us about Earth?”

Selene and I exchanged a look, caught off guard. “Zara, we have told you about Earth,” I replied carefully. “You know it’s where we came from, where humanity started.”

“No,” she shot back, her voice trembling. “You told us stories, bedtime tales about blue skies and endless oceans. But you never told us what it felt like. You never told us that people on Earth don’t live in domes, that they don’t have to worry about oxygen or dust storms.”

I felt a pang of guilt, realizing that our efforts to shield them from the painful truth had only left them feeling more isolated. They had been born here, on Mars, and their world was limited to what we could build and sustain. Earth was a distant, unreachable dream for them—a place that only existed in stories and fading memories.

Leo, who had been silent until now, spoke up, his voice barely above a whisper. “Dad… is it true that people on Earth can just… walk outside whenever they want?”

I hesitated, the words catching in my throat. “Yes, Leo. Earth is different. People there don’t need to worry about air supply or radiation. But Earth has its own struggles. That’s why we came here, to build something new, to survive.”

“But we didn’t ask to survive here,” Zara said bitterly. “You chose this life. You chose to come to Mars. We’re just… trapped here.”

The weight of her words struck me, each syllable a reminder that the choices we had made—the battles we had fought to build this Colony—had come with a cost. We had sacrificed our comfort, our connection to Earth, to give them a future. But for Zara and Leo, that future felt more like confinement.

Selene reached across the table, placing a hand on Zara’s arm. “We know it’s hard. Believe me, we do. But you’re part of something extraordinary. This Colony, this life… you’re the first generation to live entirely on Mars. You’re pioneers.”

Zara pulled her arm away, her gaze defiant. “I don’t want to be a pioneer. I want to feel the sun on my face. I want to hear waves, not machines.”

Days passed, but Zara’s frustration didn’t fade. In fact, it only grew stronger, spreading like a shadow over her and Leo. They spent more time near the observation deck, staring out at the rust-colored landscape, the dusty, lifeless horizon stretching endlessly in every direction.

One evening, I found Zara there alone, her arms crossed tightly over her chest as she watched a dust storm brew in the distance.

“You’re angry with us,” I said, stepping beside her. She didn’t look at me, her jaw set, her gaze fixed on the churning dust.

“Angry?” she echoed, her voice cold. “Maybe. I just don’t understand how you and Mom can be okay with this. Living underground, never feeling real wind. How is this living, Dad?”

I reached out, but she shrugged me off. I felt the weight of her resentment, her bitterness, and it hurt more than I could express. But I knew I couldn’t give her the answers she wanted. All I could do was share the truth.

“When we came here, it was because we believed there could be a new beginning. Earth was… it was breaking, Zara. The pollution, the wars—it wasn’t safe. Mars was a chance to build something different, something better.”

“But we’re barely surviving,” she said, her voice trembling. “People still die in the mines, Dad. The food is always the same, bland and colorless. And we’re alone here. No one from Earth has visited in years. What if they’ve forgotten about us?”

I took a deep breath, feeling the gravity of her words. It was true; Earth had stopped communicating with us. Supply ships, once a yearly occurrence, had ceased arriving. Our connection to the world we had left behind was fading, and we were becoming a world unto ourselves.

“Maybe they have forgotten,” I admitted, my voice heavy. “Maybe we’re on our own now. But that doesn’t mean we give up, Zara. You and Leo are our future. You have a chance to shape what life on Mars can be.”

She shook her head, frustration etched in every line of her face. “I don’t want to shape Mars, Dad. I want to know what it’s like to be free. Really free.”

As I watched her walk away, I felt an ache deep in my chest. The Colony was my home, my life’s work, but for Zara and Leo, it was a cage—a prison built on survival and necessity. And I couldn’t blame them for wanting something more.

Selene and I spent countless nights talking, wrestling with the questions Zara and Leo had raised. We had poured our lives into building this Colony, and yet our children—the very reason we had fought so hard to create a future here—felt trapped, longing for a freedom we couldn’t offer.

One night, after hours of quiet conversation, Selene placed a hand on my shoulder, her gaze filled with resolve.

“We need to find a way to give them hope, Caleb,” she said. “If Earth isn’t going to reach out, then maybe it’s time we reach out ourselves.”

The idea was daunting. Building a communication system powerful enough to reach Earth was nearly impossible with the resources we had. But Selene’s determination was contagious, and I found myself willing to try—to give Zara and Leo, and every child born on Mars, a chance to believe in something beyond these walls.

In the following months, the Colony came together like never before. Engineers, scientists, miners—everyone contributed to the project, pooling knowledge, resources, and hope into a single, monumental effort. We gathered every transmitter, every piece of equipment that could be repurposed, creating a crude but powerful communication array.

Finally, after months of work, we were ready.

The day we activated the signal, the Colony held its breath. The broadcast was simple, a plea for connection, a reminder that we were still here, still reaching for the world that had once been our home.

Hours passed, then days. Zara and Leo watched the skies every night, hope mingling with doubt in their eyes. And though we heard nothing back, a change had come over them. The act of reaching out, of believing in something beyond Mars, had given them a new sense of purpose.

They began to talk about what they could do, how they could make life better in the Colony, how they could bring a touch of Earth’s beauty into the harsh Martian landscape. Together, they planted flowers in the greenhouses, painted murals on the walls, filled the Colony with color and life.

In the end, maybe Earth wouldn’t answer. Maybe Mars was all we had. But as I watched Zara and Leo, as I saw the hope they had rekindled in each other, I knew that we had given them something more than survival. 

We had given them a legacy, a chance to shape their world, not as prisoners, but as pioneers—people who,
