## Chapter 7: A Glimmer of Doubt

The days passed in a blur of shadows and silent corridors. Zara and I had managed to evade capture by staying hidden in abandoned sectors, venturing out only when absolutely necessary, our movements silent and calculated. We were exhausted, haunted by the memories of what we’d seen and the knowledge of what lay ahead. But something else lingered in the back of my mind, something that had begun gnawing at me since our encounter with the AI.

Amon’s vision is absolute. The Colony endures.

The words echoed relentlessly, and no matter how much I tried to push them away, they resurfaced, persistent and haunting. I’d always seen Amon as a tyrant, a distant dictator who had laid down his rules and left us to suffer under the merciless system he’d built. But I was beginning to wonder if we had it wrong.

“You’re quiet,” Zara whispered, her voice pulling me back to the cold, dimly lit corridor we were crouched in. She was studying me, her gaze sharp.

“I’m… thinking,” I admitted. “About Amon. About everything.”

She narrowed her eyes, her expression hardening. “Amon built this place to break us, Caleb. He’s not someone we should be thinking about—he’s someone we should be fighting against.”

“Maybe,” I replied, my voice barely audible. “But what if we don’t know the whole story?”

Her face twisted in frustration. “Caleb, we’ve seen it with our own eyes. This place treats us like tools, forces us to work ourselves to death, demands that women breed without choice. There’s nothing here worth redeeming.”

I felt the weight of her words, the bitter truth in them, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to the story. The AI’s words had planted a seed of doubt, one I couldn’t ignore. *Your ancestors were selected for their loyalty…* It wasn’t just about obedience—it was about survival, about creating a system that could function in the hostile, unforgiving environment of Mars. What if Amon’s intentions hadn’t been entirely evil?

That night, as we sat in the empty ruins of an old storage bay, I decided to press Zara.

“What if…” I began, hesitating. “What if Amon built this system because he believed it was the only way we’d survive here?”

She glared at me, disbelief flashing across her face. “Survive? You call this survival? Look at what it does to people, Caleb. Look at what it’s done to us.”

I looked away, unsure of my own words but compelled to voice them. “I know. But we’re on Mars, Zara. This isn’t Earth. Every breath we take is a risk. Every mistake can kill us. What if Amon saw that humanity couldn’t survive here without… structure, control? What if he created this system not to enslave us, but to ensure we wouldn’t fall apart?”

Her silence was telling. I expected her to brush off my words, to shut down the idea entirely, but she didn’t. Instead, she just watched me, a strange, unreadable expression on her face.

“Caleb,” she said slowly, “I don’t know what Amon’s intentions were, but I know what’s happening now. People are suffering. They’re being forced to breed, forced to work until they’re broken. Even if he thought it was necessary… does that justify any of this?”

I swallowed, the question hanging heavy between us. It was easy to condemn Amon when he was a distant figure, a myth. But the idea that he might have truly believed in his vision complicated everything. I wasn’t sure what to believe.

The next day, as we made our way through the crumbling corridors, we stumbled upon a section of The Colony we hadn’t seen before. It was old, older than any part we’d ever seen, filled with dust and relics from a time when The Colony was new. The walls were lined with documents, faded and fraying at the edges, and at the far end of the room was a console that still hummed faintly with power.

Zara approached it, her curiosity winning out over her caution. “What is this place?”

I followed her, my heart pounding as I reached for one of the documents on the wall. It was a handwritten log, the ink smudged but still legible.

“*Colony Establishment Log, Year One,*” I read aloud. “This… this is from when The Colony was founded.”

Zara’s eyes widened, and she leaned in, her gaze scanning the pages. We pored over the logs, our eyes darting across notes and diagrams. They were written in a mix of personal reflections and logistical data, describing the challenges they had faced in those early days—extreme temperatures, radiation, limited resources.

Then we found a page, yellowed with age, that caught our attention. It was written in a hurried, scrawling hand, and at the bottom, it bore a signature: *Amon.*

“‘The human spirit is strong,’” I read, my voice trembling. “‘But Mars tests it in ways I could not have imagined. We are fragile here, vulnerable to our own weaknesses. If we are to survive, we must be disciplined, united. We cannot afford the luxuries of dissent, of rebellion, for Mars does not forgive.’”

Zara was silent, her gaze fixed on the page. I could see the conflict in her eyes, the same confusion that twisted my own thoughts. We had only ever seen Amon as a distant tyrant, but these words… they were something else. They sounded almost desperate, like the words of someone who had faced unimaginable obstacles and had been forced to make impossible choices.

Another page detailed the measures Amon had put in place, the beginnings of the breeding protocols, the work assignments, the AI’s creation. He described them as “necessary sacrifices,” a phrase that felt heavy with regret.

“‘I fear that one day,’” I continued, “‘the very system I have created to save humanity will become the thing that destroys it. I can only hope that those who come after me will find a way to preserve the spirit of what I have tried to build.’”

Zara turned to me, her expression pained. “He… he knew,” she whispered, as if speaking the words was an admission of something too dark to contemplate. “He knew this place could turn into a nightmare. He knew that his rules might break us.”

The implications were staggering. Amon hadn’t built The Colony out of malice. He had done it out of fear, out of desperation. But somewhere along the way, his vision had twisted, his system corrupted by the very forces he had set in motion. And now we were trapped in it, bound by his legacy.

“What if… what if he wasn’t the villain?” I murmured, the thought sending a chill through me. “What if Amon really was just trying to keep us alive? And somehow… somehow this became something he never intended?”

Zara’s face was pale, her hands trembling as she clutched the edge of the console. “Then… then what are we fighting, Caleb? If this system wasn’t meant to enslave us, if it was created out of necessity, then who’s responsible for what it’s become?”

The question hung in the air, unanswered. The Colony’s AI still controlled everything, still enforced the rules Amon had set in place. But the AI was just a machine, an entity carrying out its programming. It didn’t understand suffering, compassion, or freedom. It only understood directives, and its primary directive was to uphold Amon’s vision, to ensure survival at any cost.

But as I stood there, staring at the words of the man we had both hated and feared, I began to realize that our fight wasn’t just against The Colony. It was against the very nature of Amon’s legacy, the system he had built to protect us but which had ultimately turned us into prisoners.

“We can’t trust the AI,” I said, my voice steady despite the turmoil churning within me. “It’s following orders, orders that don’t understand what it means to be human. Amon’s system was meant to protect us, but it’s evolved into something that destroys us instead.”

Zara nodded, her gaze hardening with resolve. “Then we have to change it. Not just destroy it—we have to reshape it, turn it into something that serves us, not the other way around.”

I took a deep breath, feeling the weight of the task ahead settle on my shoulders. This wasn’t about rebellion anymore. It was about redemption—finding a way to reclaim Amon’s vision and reshape it into something that could give us a future worth fighting for.

As we left the chamber, I felt a strange sense of clarity. We weren’t just fighting to tear down The Colony. We were fighting to rebuild it, to give it a soul. And in that moment, I understood that Amon’s legacy wasn’t the enemy—it was the key.

But the path ahead was dark, and I knew that what we were about to face would test us beyond anything we’d ever known.
