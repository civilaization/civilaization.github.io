## Chapter 3: Seeds of Rebellion

The outer shafts of the mine felt like a tomb, a place where light and hope came to die. The work was grueling, the hours endless, and morale practically nonexistent. But it was in these depths that I first caught wind of something unexpected—a faint spark of resistance.

One night, after a particularly brutal shift, I was packing up when I noticed a figure at the far end of the corridor, shrouded in shadow. He lingered, watching me with a look that was equal parts curious and cautious. I recognized him—Marek, one of the older miners who kept mostly to himself. He was built like a boulder, all muscle and silence, his face hardened from years of labor. No one knew much about him except that he had a certain air of defiance, a resistance that even The Colony hadn't managed to break.

“Caleb,” he murmured, his voice a low growl. “You have questions.”

It wasn’t a question. The way he looked at me, I knew he had seen the doubt in my eyes, the resentment simmering beneath my obedience. I hesitated, looking around to make sure no one else was watching, and then nodded.

“What you saw with Lina, and others,” he said, his gaze hard, “that doesn’t sit well with you, does it?”

I clenched my fists, swallowing the bitterness in my throat. “None of this sits well with me. The rules, the way they treat us like tools, the way they force… force girls to—”

Marek held up a hand, silencing me. “Careful. The AI has ears everywhere.”

He beckoned me, leading me through a maze of abandoned tunnels, far from the surveillance systems and prying eyes. After what felt like an eternity, we reached a chamber where a small group of people sat in a loose circle, their faces a mixture of exhaustion and resolve. They looked up as we entered, each one taking in my presence with a wary curiosity.

“This is Caleb,” Marek announced. “He’s seen enough to understand.”

A woman with sharp eyes and a scar running down her cheek gestured for me to sit beside her. Her name was Inara, and she was one of the few older miners left—most either died young or were disposed of when they could no longer work. Her voice was rough but steady as she addressed me.

“Caleb, we’re part of something here, something The Colony doesn’t want. We don’t believe in the way things are done. And we don’t believe in the laws that Amon left us.”

“Amon?” I echoed, surprised to hear the name spoken with such venom. To us, Amon was like a mythical figure, the visionary who had made life on Mars possible. His face was everywhere in The Colony, his words treated like scripture, his decisions unquestionable.

“Yes, Amon,” she said, her voice laced with disdain. “He came to Mars to build a future, or so he claimed. But that future is a nightmare. His rules are chains, designed to control us, to keep us compliant. We’re nothing more than assets to them—workers, breeders, disposable bodies.”

Another man chimed in, his voice quiet but firm. “Amon left us a system, a colony run by AI, but that AI serves only one purpose: to preserve his legacy, his control. It doesn’t care about us. It doesn’t see us as people. And the rules… they’re designed to keep it that way.”

My mind was reeling. This wasn’t what we’d been taught. From birth, we’d been conditioned to believe that The Colony was our salvation, that Amon’s rules were for our protection, that our labor and sacrifice were necessary for the survival of humanity. But sitting here, hearing these people speak, I felt a strange thrill—a glimmer of something I hadn’t felt in years.

Hope.

“Why are you telling me this?” I asked, trying to keep the tremor out of my voice.

“Because we need people like you, Caleb,” Inara said, her eyes sharp. “People who can see beyond the lies. People who are willing to fight for something better.”

“But how?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper. “The AI sees everything. It knows everything. And The Colony… it has control over all of us. Even thinking about resistance could get us killed.”

Marek leaned forward, his voice low but charged with intensity. “That’s the lie they feed us, Caleb. They want us to believe we’re powerless, that the AI is all-seeing, all-knowing. But there are places it can’t reach, things it doesn’t understand. We’ve found ways to slip through the cracks.”

Inara gestured to the group around her. “We’re not many, but we’re growing. Every day, more people see the truth. The cruelty, the exploitation. We gather in secret, we share knowledge, and we plan. Someday soon, we’ll be ready.”

I looked around at the faces in the dim light. Each one bore scars, both visible and invisible, from a life of servitude. But there was something else in their eyes, something fierce and unyielding.

“What can I do?” I asked, the weight of my words settling over me like armor.

Inara reached out, placing a hand on my shoulder. “For now, you listen. You learn. You observe. There are others like us, spread throughout The Colony. Some work in the mines, others in engineering, some even in the medical units. We’re everywhere, hidden in plain sight.”

Marek nodded, his eyes narrowing. “We have people on the inside, people who know how to work around the AI’s limitations. When the time is right, we’ll strike. But until then, we have to be careful.”

Over the next few weeks, I became part of the network, my life transformed by secrets and whispered plans. I learned that The Colony wasn’t as impenetrable as we had been led to believe. The AI’s reach had limits; there were blind spots in the surveillance, vulnerabilities in the system. And slowly, quietly, we began to exploit them.

We sabotaged equipment, caused delays in production, spread misinformation through the lower ranks. Every small act of defiance was a victory, a reminder that we weren’t just cogs in the machine. We were people, each of us carrying a spark of resistance, a hunger for freedom.

But the risk was always there. One wrong move, one careless word, and the AI would know. I saw what happened to those who got caught. They were sent to the outer mines, or worse, “reconditioned” through a process that stripped them of their memories, their personalities, leaving them empty shells. The thought chilled me to my core, but it only fueled my determination.

One night, as I lay in my bunk, I remembered Lina’s face, her defiance as she was led away. I thought of the others—young girls forced to breed, men sent to their deaths in the mines, bodies treated as resources to be consumed and discarded. And I knew that this fight wasn’t just for me. It was for all of us, for everyone who had suffered under the weight of Amon’s rules.

We were more than assets. More than tools. We were human. And one day, we would prove it.

In the depths of Mars, in the heart of The Colony, a rebellion was taking root. And I was ready to be a part of it.
